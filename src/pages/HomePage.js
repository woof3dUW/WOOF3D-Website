                <h1>About the Club</h1>
                <p>As the 3D printing club at UW, we provide a hub for anyone interested in 3D printing. 
                    Whether youâ€™re a beginner or an expert, we have something for everyone. Experience is not required, and neither is any time commitment.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <h3>What Does the Club Do?</h3>
                <p>Fall Quarter: We hold weekly workshops mostly aimed towards beginners. This includes everything from how to use a 
                    3D printer to how to 3D print textiles. Show up to as many as you want!
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Winter and Spring Quarters: During these quarters, we provide members with the opportunity to work on a larger 
                    scale 3D printing project with other members. Joining a team is not required but it is a good way to get hands on 
                    experience with 3D printing and maybe even learn a bit about hardware or software in the process. 
                    Check out the Projects tab for information on current and past projects!
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <h3>Cost</h3>
                <p>Attending all workshops is completely free. There is a $25 fee to become a full fledged club member. 
                    This gives you access to unlimited filament, access to the club's printers, as well as free pizza at the end of each quarter at the club social.
